## Block Diagram
The Full Adder circuit consists of:
- Two input bits (A,B)
- A carry-in bit (Cin)
- A sum output (s)
- A carry-out output(Cout)
This circuit performs the binary addition of two bits with carry-in, producing a sum and a carry-out as the result.

##Circuit Diagram
The circuit is based on CMOS technology and uses a combination of logic gates to produce the desired output. A schematic will be provided in the repository that shows how these components interact.
